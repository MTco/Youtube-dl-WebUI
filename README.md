## Description
Youtube-dl WebUI is a small web interface for youtube-dl/yt-dlp. It allows you to host your own video downloader. 
After the download you can stream your videos from your web browser (or VLC or others)
or save it on your computer directly from the list page.

It supports:

* simultaneous downloads in background
* yt-dlp, youtube-dl (and others)
* logging
* fetch info without download

### You can now extract the audio of a video and download multiple videos at the same time !

## Requirements
- A web server (Apache or nginx) on Unix system.
- PHP >= 7 version should be fine.
- Python >= 2.7 for Youtube-dl.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).
- ffmpeg (or avconv) is required for audio extraction (from youtube-dl doc) :
`-x, --extract-audio convert video files to audio-only files (requires ffmpeg or avconv and ffprobe or avprobe)`
